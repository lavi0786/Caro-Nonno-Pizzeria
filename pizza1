Preheat a baking stone on the center rack of the oven at 550°F (or the highest your oven will go) for at least 45 minutes. Once heated, turn on the broiler. Alternatively you can use a pizza oven.
Crush the tomatoes either by using your hands, in a food processor or with an immersion blender by pulsing a few times. Season to taste with salt.
Place one ball of dough ball on a floured surface and begin stretching it out into a circle.
Place it over the back of your hands and use your knuckles to gently stretch it out to about 12 inches in diameter. Be careful not to tear the dough.
Transfer to a pizza peel that’s been dusted with flour. Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce across the dough, leaving a 1-2 inch border.
Sprinkle half of the fontina on top first, then tear the mozzarella into pieces and distribute half of it around the pizza. Dot the top with half of the gorgonzola, then sprinkle with grated Parmigiano. Give the pizza a shake to make sure nothing is sticking, then immediately slide it onto the baking stone.Watch closely as it cooks, rotating if necessary, but try to keep the oven door closed to retain as much heat as possible.
Remove the pizza from the oven and drizzle with olive oil if desired. It’s done when the crust is lightly charred around the edges and the cheese is melted, about 4-8 minutes.

Transfer to a cutting board, then cut into slices and serve immediately. Repeat with the remaining dough.
